        Need to use 'a'nchor to wrap text as link.

        This opens the link in the same tab, target
        attribute is set to '_self' by default

        This is a 'relative' link, i.e link to 
        another page within our website with
        the file path. 'Absolute' links are links 
        to the actual domain

        './' in front pages is for looking for the
        file relative to the current dir

    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

    <!-- 
        Setting target = "_blank" opens a new tab.

        rel describes relation btwn current page and
        linked document. 
        
        'noopener' ensures the link can't interact 
        w/ the original page. JS can be used to
        interact w/ the original page which is 
        dangerous.

        'noreferrer' prevents new page from knowing
        where the user came from and also prevents
        the original page from being accessed.
